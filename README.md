# PythonDataEncrypt-er
This is DAY1 of 100 days of code, this is a data encrypt-er it will encrypt anything set of text upto a 4096 bit key, it is currently set to a 4096 bit key size, It will take longer (upto a min) on 4096, i suggest changing it to a 512 bit size. The code writes encrypted messages to the .txt file, for now you have to manually delete messages, will fix ltr. //blainto
